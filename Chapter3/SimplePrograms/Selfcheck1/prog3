/*Describe the problem inputs and outputs and write the algorithm for a program
that computes an employee’s gross salary given the hours worked and
the hourly rate.
In computing gross salary, what changes should you make to extend the payroll
algorithm in Self-Check Exercise 1 to include overtime hours to be paid at
1.5 times an employee’s normal hourly rate? Assume that overtime hours are
entered separately
Analysis:
The employers number of hours will be multiplied by the hourly rate.
Data Requirements :
Problem Inputs :
double num_of_hrs_worked.
double hourly_rate.
double overtime.
Problem Output :
double Salary
Relevant Formula :
pay = num_of hrs_of worked * hourly_rate 
ot_pay = number of hrs_of_worked * (hourly_rate * 1.5)
salary = pay + ot+pay
Design :
We will design the algorithms next
Algorithm:
1-Get the number of hours employer worked
1.1Get the number of hours employer worked in overtime
2-Get the hourly rate
3-compute the salary
4-Display the salary of employer
step 3 refinement 
computer num_of_hrs_worked over time and hourly rate 
pay= num_of_hrs_worked * hourly_rate
ot_pay = number of hrs worked in overtime  * (hourly_rate * 1.5)
salary  =  pay + ot_pay
Program:*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    float num_of_hrs_worked, ot_hrs, hourly_rate, salary;
    printf("please type number of hrs you worked:\n");
    scanf("%f", &num_of_hrs_worked);
    printf("please type number of hours you worked overtime\n");
    scanf("%f", &ot_hrs);
    printf("Please type hourly rate :\n");
    scanf("%f", &hourly_rate);
    salary = (num_of_hrs_worked * hourly_rate) + (ot_hrs * (hourly_rate * 1.5)) ;
    printf("Your Salary will be %.3f"), salary;
    
    
    
    return 0;
